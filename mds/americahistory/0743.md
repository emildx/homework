The United States played a crucial role in ﬁnancing World War I. In its war-related
expenditures, totaling $22.6 billion, the United States ranked fourth among all
nations that participated, ranking behind only Germany ($37.7 billion), Britain
($35.3 billion), and France ($24.3 billion). In human terms, however, the U.S. role
was different. Note that the ﬁgures below for military casualties are rough esti-
mates. Civilian casualties are even more uncertain: the exact number of Russians,
Italians, Romanians, Serbians, and others who died will never be known.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  What does this data suggest about the comparative role
of the United States in World War I? The experience of
its soldiers? The war’s impact on civilians in each nation?

2.  Which other countries made contributions similar to

that of the United States, and why?

profits soared, as military production sustained a boom
that continued until 1920.

Some federal agencies took dramatic measures. The
National  War  Labor  Board (NWLB), formed in April
1918,  established  an  eight-hour  day  for  war  workers
with time-and-a-half pay for overtime, and it endorsed
equal pay for women. In return for a no-strike pledge,
the NWLB also supported workers’ right to organize —
a major achievement for the labor movement. The Fuel

Administration,  meanwhile,  introduced  daylight  sav-
ing time to conserve coal and oil. In December 1917,
the  Railroad  Administration  seized  control  of  the
nation’s  hodgepodge  of  private  railroads,  seeking  to
facilitate rapid movement of troops and equipment —
an experiment that had, at best, mixed results.

Perhaps  the  most  successful  wartime  agency  was
the Food Administration, created in August 1917 and
led by engineer Herbert Hoover. With the slogan “Food
