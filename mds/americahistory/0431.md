A Slave Family Picking Cotton  Picking cotton — thousands of small bolls attached to 3-foot-high
woody and often prickly stalks — was a tedious and time-consuming task, taking up to four months
on many plantations. However, workers of both sexes and all ages could pick cotton, and masters
could measure output by weighing the baskets of each picker or family, chastising those who failed to
meet their quotas. What does this early photograph of a family of pickers, taken on a plantation near
Savannah, Georgia, suggest about women’s and children’s lives, family relations, and living conditions?
