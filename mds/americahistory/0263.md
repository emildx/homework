Virginia, she will gain by stopping the importations. Her
slaves will rise in value, and she has more than she wants.
It would be unequal to require South Carolina and
Georgia to confederate on such unequal terms. . . . He
contended that the importation of slaves would be for the
interest of the whole Union. The more slaves, the more
produce to employ the carrying trade; the more con-
sumption also; and the more of this, the more revenue for
the common treasury. . . . [He] should consider a rejec-
tion of the [present] clause as an exclusion of South
Carolina from the Union.

The Massachusetts Ratifying Convention

In  Philadelphia,  the  delegates  agreed  on  a  compromise:
they  gave  Congress  the  power  to  tax  or  prohibit  slave
imports, as Luther Martin had proposed, but withheld that
power for twenty years. In the Massa chusetts convention,
the delegates split on this issue and on many others. They
ratiﬁed the Constitution by a narrow margin, 187 to 168.

Mr. Neal (from Kittery) [an Antifederalist] went over the
ground of objection to . . . the idea that slave trade was
allowed to be continued for 20 years. His profession, he
said, obliged him to bear witness against any thing that
should favor the making merchandize of the bodies of
men, and unless his objection was removed, he could not
put his hand to the constitution. Other gentlemen said,
in addition to this idea, that there was not even a prop-
osition that the negroes ever shall be free: and Gen.
Thompson exclaimed — “Mr. President, shall it be
said, that after we have established our own indepen-
dence and freedom, we make slaves of others? Oh!
Washington . . . he has immortalized himself! but
he holds those in slavery who have a good right to
be free as he is. . . .”

On the other side, gentlemen said, that the step taken
in this article, towards the abolition of slavery, was one of
the beauties of the constitution. They observed, that in the
confederation there was no provision whatever for its ever
being abolished; but this constitution provides, that
Congress may after twenty years, totally annihilate the
slave trade. . . .

Mr. Heath (Federalist): . . . I apprehend that it is not in
our power to do any thing for or against those who are in
slavery in the southern states. No gentleman within these
walls detests every idea of slavery more than I do: it is
generally detested by the people of this commonwealth,
and I ardently hope that the time will soon come, when
our brethren in the southern states will view it as we do,
and put a stop to it; but to this we have no right to compel
them.

Two questions naturally arise: if we ratify the

Constitution, shall we do any thing by our act to hold the
blacks in slavery or shall we become the partakers of
other men’s sins? I think neither of them: each state is
sovereign and independent to a certain degree, and they
have a right, and will regulate their own internal affairs, as
to themselves appears proper. . . . We are not in this case
partakers of other men’s sins. . . .

The federal convention went as far as they could; the

migration or immigration &c. is confined to the states,
now existing only, new states cannot claim it. Congress,
by their ordnance for erecting new states, some time
since, declared that there shall be no slavery in them. But
whether those in slavery in the southern states, will be
emancipated after the year 1808, I do not pretend to
determine: I rather doubt it.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, what

were the main arguments for and against federal restric-
tions on the Atlantic slave trade? How do you explain
the position taken by the Connecticut delegates in Phila-
delphia and Mr. Heath in the Massachusetts debate?
2.  What argument does George Mason, a Virginia slave
owner, make in favor of prohibiting the Atlantic slave
trade?

3.  What evidence of regional tensions appears in the docu-
ments? Several men from different states — Mason from
Virginia, Ellsworth from Connecticut, and Heath from
Massachusetts — offered predictions about the future of
slavery. How accurate were they?
