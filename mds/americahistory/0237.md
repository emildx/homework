General Washington, 1780  By war’s end, George Washington was a hero on both sides of the
Atlantic. This engraving, printed in Paris in 1780, shows him with various British bills and declarations in
tatters at his feet while he holds copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Treaty of Alliance
with France. In the background of this vaguely Orientalized scene, a black slave — presumably William
Lee, Washington’s valet and constant companion during the Revolution — saddles his horse. Anne S. K. Brown
