Revolution and
Republican Culture
1763–1820

“The American war is over,” Philadelphia Patriot Benjamin Rush declared

in 1787, “but this is far from being the case with the American Revolu-

tion. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed.

It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government.” The

changes that had already unfolded since 1763 were revolutionary in them-

selves: Britain had triumphed in the Great War for Empire, only to see its

American empire unravel and descend into war. Against all odds, the thir-

teen rebelling colonies had pulled together and won their independence;

now they were forming a federal republic that would take its place among

the nations of the world.

The republican revolution extended far beyond politics. It challenged

many  of  the  values  and  institutions  that  had  prevailed  for  centuries  in

Europe and the Atlantic World. After 1776, Americans reconsidered basic

assumptions that structured their societies, cultures, families, and com-

munities.  Here,  in  summary,  are  the  three  principal  developments  dis-

cussed in Part 3:
