QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  Compare Britain’s colonies in their roles as

producers of British imports to their roles as
consumers of British exports. Why are the
mainland colonies of North America a distant
third as producers of imports, but ranked ﬁrst
as consumers of exports?

2.  How did the American Revolution (1776–1783)
impact the economic relationship between
Great Britain and its mainland colonies? Is it
reasonable to conclude that political indepen-
dence did not bring economic independence?

America. The ministers who served under George III
(r. 1760–1820) feared a possible rebellion by the 60,000
French residents of Canada, Britain’s newly conquered
colony  (Map  5.2).  Native  Americans  were  also  a
concern: Pontiac’s Rebellion had nearly overwhelmed

Britain’s  frontier  forts.  Moreover,  only  a  substantial
military  force  would  deter  land-hungry  whites  from
defying the Proclamation of 1763 and settling west of
the  Appalachian  Mountains  (see  Chapter  4).  Finally,
British politicians worried about the colonists’ loyalty
