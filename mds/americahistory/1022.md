Global Capitalism
and the End of the
American Century
1980 to the Present

For historians, the recent past can be a challenge to evaluate and assess.

Insufficient  time  has  passed  for  scholars  to  weigh  the  significance  of

events and to determine which developments will have a lasting effect and

which are more fleeting. Nevertheless, the period between the early 1980s

and our own day has begun to emerge in the minds of historians with

some clarity. Scholars generally agree on the era’s three most significant

developments:  the  resurgence  of  political  conservatism,  the  end  of  the

Cold  War,  and  the  globalization  of  communications  and  the  economy.

What  Time  magazine  publisher  Henry  Luce  had  named  the  American

Century — in his call for the United States to assume global leadership in

the  decades  after  World  War  II — came  decisively  to  an  end  in  the  last

quarter of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first.

The  United  States  lost  its  role  as  the  world’s  dominant  economy,  faced

rising competition from a united Europe and a surging China, and expe-

rienced a wide-ranging and divisive internal debate over its own values

and  priorities.  Part  9  remains  necessarily  a  work-in-progress  as  events

continue to unfold; however, through equal parts conflict, struggle, and

ingenuity,  Americans  collectively  created  a  new  era  in  national  history

after the 1980s, which we consider in terms of the aforementioned three

developments:
