The Cold War and Colonial
Independence
Insisting that all nations had to choose sides, the United
States drew as many countries as possible into collec-
tive  security  agreements,  with  the  NATO  alliance  in
Europe  as  a  model.  Secretary  of  State  John  Foster
Dulles orchestrated the creation of the Southeast Asia
Treaty  Organization  (SEATO),  which  in  1954  linked
the  United  States  and  its  major  European  allies  with
Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, and
Thailand.  An  extensive  system  of  defense  alliances
eventually  tied  the  United  States  to  more  than  forty

other  countries  (Map  25.5).  The  United  States  also
sponsored  a  strategically  valuable  defensive  alliance
between  Iraq  and  Iran,  on  the  southern  flank  of  the
Soviet Union.

Despite  American  rhetoric,  the  United  States  was
often concerned less about democracy than about sta-
bility.  The  Truman  and  Eisenhower  administrations
tended to support governments, no matter how repres-
sive, that were overtly anticommunist. Some of Amer-
ica’s  staunchest  allies — the  Philippines,  South  Korea,
Iran,  Cuba,  South  Vietnam,  and  Nicaragua — were
governed  by  dictatorships  or  right-wing  regimes  that
lacked  broad-based  support.  Moreover,  Eisenhower’s

American Global Defense Treaties in the Cold War Era

The advent of the Cold War led to a major shift in American foreign policy — the signing of mutual
defense treaties. Dating back to George Washington’s call “to steer clear of permanent alliances
with any portion of the foreign world,” the United States had avoided treaty obligations that
entailed the defense of other nations. As late as 1919, the U.S. Senate had rejected the principle of
“collective security,” the centerpiece of the League of Nations established by the Treaty of Versailles
that ended World War I. But after World War II, in response to fears of Soviet global expansion, the
United States entered defense alliances with much of the non-Communist world.
