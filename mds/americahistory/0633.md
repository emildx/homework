 . . . The result is that No. 1,111 does not now speak to

4.  Estimated residential telephones in three California
locations, 1900–1940 (top of page). Palo Alto was
an afﬂuent university town. Antioch was working-
class. San Rafael had a mixed economy, including
some industry; it served increasingly as a bedroom
community for San Francisco professionals.

excuse for telephoning an invitation when time is not
an object, or when the person invited is not an intimate
friend.

6.  Bell Telephone advertisement, 1910. The text from
this ad was accompanied by a picture of a young
woman on the telephone with young men and
women in a room behind her, dancing.

For Social Arrangements: The informal invitation which
comes over the phone is generally the most welcome. The
Bell service makes it possible to arrange delightful social
affairs at the last moment. . . .

5.  Telephone etiquette from “A Woman of Fashion,”
1898. At the turn of the century, etiquette authori-
ties began grudgingly to acknowledge the role of
telephones in social life. Do you notice any contra-
dictions in the advice below?

Invitations by telephone, for anything other than infor-
mal engagements . . . are hopelessly vulgar. They should
be the last resort. Invitations to bicycle or to play golf may
be transmitted in this way, and the telephone is a blessing
often in adjusting details, or making explanations; but for
most social matters the use of the telephone is question-
able, at best. Many women will stand with aching feet and
irritated brow at a telephone for half an hour rather than
write a note which would take four minutes. . . . Invita-
tion by telephone is one of those modern innovations
to which the conservative have never been accustomed,
and which shocks elderly, conventional persons still. The
convenience of the telephone for quickness and prompt
response appeals, however, to so many persons, that it
is hopeless and useless to inveigh against it. . . . If some
one’s note has been mislaid or forgotten, there is nothing
simpler than to telephone to repair the error, and to explain.
It is much speedier than sending a note. . . . There is no

For Impromptu Invitations: The easiest way to get up an
informal party, quickly, is by telephone.

ANALYZING THE EVIDENCE

1.  Consider the audience for each of these sources. Who
was intended to read, view, or listen to it? What mes-
sage does it convey?

2.  Sources 2, 5, and 6 all give advice on how women should
behave. Compare these pieces of advice. In what ways
are they similar and different?

3.  Based on these sources, which groups of Americans
appear to have been affected by the arrival of tele-
phones, and how?

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Using evidence from these sources and your knowledge
of the period, write an essay explaining how the tele-
phone contributed to, and reﬂected, changes in American
women’s social and economic roles.
