Industrial America:
Corporations and Conflicts
1877–1911

For  millions  of  his  contemporaries,

IDENTIFY THE BIG IDEA
What  new  opportunities  and  risks
did industrialization bring, and how
did it reshape American society?

Andrew Carnegie exempliﬁed Amer-
ican success. Arriving from Scotland
as a poor twelve-year-old in 1848, Carnegie
found work as an errand boy for the Penn-
sylvania Railroad and rapidly scaled the managerial ladder. In 1865, he struck out on his
own as an iron manufacturer, selling to friends in the railroad business. Encouraged by
Republican tariffs to enter the steel industry, he soon built a massive steel mill outside
Pittsburgh where a state-of-the-art Bessemer converter made steel reﬁning dramatically
more  efﬁcient.  With  Carnegie  leading  the  way,  steel  became  a  major  U.S.  industry,
reaching annual production of 10 million metric tons by 1900 — almost as much as the
combined output of the world’s other top producers, Germany (6.6 million tons) and
Britain (4.8 million).

At  ﬁrst,  skilled  workers  at  Carnegie’s  mill  in  Homestead,  Pennsylvania,  earned
good wages. They had a strong union, and Carnegie afﬁrmed workers’ right to orga-
nize. But Carnegie — conﬁdent that new machinery enabled him to replace many skilled
laborers — eventually decided that collective bargaining was too expensive. In the sum-
mer of 1892, he withdrew to his estate in Scotland, leaving his partner Henry Clay Frick
in command. A former coal magnate and veteran foe of labor, Frick was well qualiﬁed
to do the dirty work. He announced that after July 1, members of the Amalgamated
Association of Iron and Steel Workers would be locked out of the Homestead mill. If
they wanted to return to work, they would have to abandon the union and sign new
individual contracts. Frick fortiﬁed the mill and prepared to hire replacement workers.
The battle was on.

At dawn on July 6, barges chugging up the Monongahela River brought dozens of
private armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, hired by Carnegie to defend
the plant. Locked-out workers opened ﬁre, starting a gunﬁght that left seven workers
and  three  Pinkertons  dead.  Frick  appealed  to  Pennsylvania’s  governor,  who  sent  the
state militia to arrest labor leaders on charges of riot and murder. Most of the locked-
out workers lost their jobs. The union was dead.

As the Homestead lockout showed, industrialization was a controversial and often
bloody process. During the half century after the Civil War, more and more Americans
worked not as independent farmers or artisans but as employees of large corporations.
Conditions of work changed for people of all economic classes. Drawn by the dynamic
economy, immigrants arrived from around the globe. These transformations provoked
working people, including farmers as well as industrial workers, to organize and defend
their interests.
