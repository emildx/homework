A Middle-Class Marriage  During the 1830s, Joseph H. Davis used bright watercolors to paint scores
of family portraits — 150 still survive — that capture the comfortable lives of New England’s middle classes.
This double portrait commemorates the marriage of Hannah Roberts and Lewis Tebbets of Berwick,
Maine. To emphasize their romantic love, Davis shows them gazing into each other’s eyes, their hands
linked by a prayer book, a symbol of their education and piety. Such respectable couples — Lewis Tebbets
became a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church — ﬂocked to hear Ralph Waldo Emerson and other
lecturers on the lyceum circuit. Terra Foundation for American Art, Chicago/Art Resource, NY.
