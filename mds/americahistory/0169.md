John Collet, George Whiteﬁeld Preaching  No painting could capture English minister George
Whiteﬁeld’s charismatic appeal, although this image conveys his open demeanor and religious intensity.
When Whiteﬁeld spoke to a crowd near Philadelphia, an observer noted that his words were “sharper
than a two-edged sword. . . . Some of the people were pale as death; others were wringing their
hands . . . and most lifting their eyes to heaven and crying to God for mercy.” An astute businessman as
well as a charismatic preacher, Whiteﬁeld tirelessly promoted the sale of his sermons and books. © Private
