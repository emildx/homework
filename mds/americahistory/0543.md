Jourdon Anderson
Letter, August 7, 1865

Anderson had escaped with his family from Tennessee and
settled in Dayton, Ohio. He dictated this letter to a friend,
and it later appeared in the New York Tribune. Folklorists
have reported on ways that enslaved people found, even
in bondage, for “puttin’ down” masters. But only in free-
dom — and in a northern state — could Anderson’s sarcasm
be expressed so openly.

To My Old Master, Colonel P. H. Anderson, Big Spring,
Tennessee.
Sir:

I got your letter, and was glad to find that you had not
forgotten Jourdon. . . . I thought the Yankees would have
hung you long before this, for harboring Rebs. . . .

I want to know particularly what the good chance is
you propose to give me. I am doing tolerably well here. I
get twenty-five dollars a month, with victuals and cloth-
ing; have a comfortable home for Mandy, — the folks here
call her Mrs. Anderson, — and the children — Milly, Jane,
and Grundy — go to school and are learning well. . . .

Mandy says she would be afraid to go back without
some proof that you were disposed to treat us justly and
kindly; and we have concluded to test your sincerity by
asking you to send us our wages for the time we served
you. This will make us forget and forgive old scores, and
rely on your justice and friendship in the future. I served
you faithfully for thirty-two years, and Mandy twenty
years. At twenty-five dollars a month for me and two dol-
lars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to
eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. Add to
this the interest for the time our wages have been kept
back, and deduct what you paid for our clothing, and
three doctor’s visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy,
and the balance will show what we are in justice entitled
to. Please send the balance by Adams Express, in care of
V. Winters, esq., Dayton, Ohio. If you do not pay us for
faithful labors in the past we can have little faith in your
promises in the future. . . .

In answering this letter, please state if there would be
any safety for my Milly and Jane, who are now grown up,
and both good-looking girls. . . . I would rather stay here
and starve — and die, if it come to that — than have my
girls brought to shame by the violence and wickedness of
their young masters. You will also please state if there has
been any schools opened for the colored children in your
neighborhood. The great desire of my life now is to give
my children an education, and have them form virtuous
habits.

From your old servant,
Jourdon Anderson
P.S. Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him for
taking the pistol from you when you were shooting at me.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS
1.  Compare Ravenel’s and Heyward’s attitudes toward

freedmen and freedwomen. How did their views differ,
and on what points did they agree?

2.  What predictions did Ravenel and Heyward make about
the South’s postwar future? How might their expecta-
tions have shaped their own actions?

3.  Soustan and Anderson both wrote to men who had for-

merly claimed them as property. How do you account for
their different outlooks and approaches? What condi-
tions of life does each mention? What inferences might
be drawn from this about the varied postwar experi-
ences of freedpeople?
