Mrs. Hugh McCurdy and Her Daughters  This 1806 portrait of Grace Allison McCurdy and her
daughters, Mary Jane and Letitia Grace, excludes her husband, the Baltimore merchant Hugh McCurdy,
suggesting the increased cultural focus on mothers and children in the early republic. A few years earlier,
the artist, Joshua Johnson (or Johnston, c. 1763–c. 1824), had painted a solo portrait of Letitia Grace. Here
Johnson links Mrs. McCurdy and her elder daughter visually with a splash of vibrant red fruit near their
laps, which probably also serves as a symbol of their fertility. Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., USA/Museum
Purchase through the gifts of William Wilson Corcoran, Elizabeth Donner Norment, Francis Biddle, Erich Cohn, Hardinge Scholle and the William A.
