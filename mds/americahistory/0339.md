Women Weavers from Maine, c. 1860  Nineteenth-century workers were proud of their skills
and, like these textiles operatives from Winthrop, Maine, often posed for photographs with the tools of
their craft. This small tintype, 3 by 4 inches and printed on thin metal, dates from the mid-nineteenth
century. Beginning in the 1830s, cotton textile entrepreneurs built factories in rural Maine, attracted by
its abundant water power and the inexpensive labor of young farm women. The women wear striped
dresses of cotton fabric, which they probably helped to manufacture. American Textile History Museum.
