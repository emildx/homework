Land Division in the Northwest Territory

Throughout the Northwest Territory, government surveyors imposed a rectangular grid on the
landscape, regardless of the local topography, so that farmers bought neatly deﬁned tracts of land.
The right-angled property lines in Muskingum County, Ohio (lower left), contrasted sharply with
those in Baltimore County, Maryland (lower right), where — as in most of the eastern and southern
states — boundaries followed the contours of the land.
