  BRITISH NORTH AMERICA AND THE ATLANTIC WORLD, 1660–1763

fraudulent) Indian deed to claim more than a million
acres  of  prime  farmland  north  of  Philadelphia.  This
purchase, while opening new lands to settlement, poi-
soned  Indian  relations  in  the  colony.  Delaware  and
Shawnee  migration  to  western  Pennsylvania  and  the
Ohio Valley, which was already under way, accelerated
rapidly in response.

EXPLAIN
CONSEQUENCES
How did rapid immigration
and economic growth trig-
ger conﬂict in the Middle
colonies?

Immigrants flooded into Philadelphia, which grew
from  2,000  people  in  1700  to  25,000  by  1760.  Many
families  came  in  search  of  land;
for  them,  Philadelphia  was  only
a  temporary  way  station.  Other
migrants came as laborers, includ-
ing a large number of indentured
servants.  Some  were  young,
unskilled  men,  but  the  colony’s
explosive  growth  also  created  a
strong demand for all kinds of skilled laborers, espe-
cially in the construction trades.

Pennsylvania and New Jersey grew prosperous but
contentious. New Jersey was plagued by contested land
titles,  and  ordinary  settlers  rioted  against  the  propri-
etors in the 1740s and the 1760s. By the 1760s, eastern
Pennsylvania landowners with large farms were using
slaves  and  poor  Scots-Irish  migrants  to  grow  wheat.
Other ambitious men were buying up land and divid-
ing it into small tenancies, which they lent out on prof-
itable leases. Still others sold farming equipment and

manufactured  goods  or  ran  mills.  These  large-scale
farmers, rural landlords, speculators, storekeepers, and
gristmill  operators  formed  a  distinct  class  of  agricul-
tural capitalists. They built large stone houses for their
families,  furnishing  them  with  four-poster  beds  and
expensive mahogany tables, on which they laid elegant
linen and imported Dutch dinnerware.

By contrast, one-half of the Middle colonies’ white
men owned no land and little personal property. Some
were the sons of smallholding farmers and would even-
tually inherit some land. But many were Scots-Irish or
German “inmates” — single men or families, explained
a tax assessor, “such as live in small cottages and have
no  taxable  property,  except  a  cow.”  In  the  predomi-
nantly German township of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a
merchant  noted  an  “abundance  of  Poor  people”  who
“maintain  their  Families  with  great  difficulty  by  day
Labour.” Although these workers hoped eventually to
become landowners, rising land prices prevented many
from realizing their dreams.

Cultural Diversity
The Middle Atlantic colonies were not a melting pot.
Most European migrants held tightly to their traditions,
creating a patchwork of ethnically and religiously diverse
communities (Figure 4.2). In 1748, a Swedish traveler
counted no fewer than twelve religious denominations

FIGURE 4.2
Estimated European Migration to the
British Mainland Colonies, 1700–1780

After 1720, European migration to British
North America increased dramatically,
peaking between 1740 and 1780, when
more than 264,000 settlers arrived in the
mainland colonies. Emigration from
Germany peaked in the 1740s, but the
number of migrants from Ireland, Scotland,
England, and Wales continued to increase
during the 1760s and early 1770s. Most
migrants, including those from Ireland,
were Protestants.
