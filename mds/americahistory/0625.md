advocated what he saw as the most practical defensive
plan. In the meantime, the upheaval wrought by indus-
trialization  spread  far  beyond  the  workplace,  trans-
forming every aspect of American life.

SUMMARY
The end of the Civil War ushered in the era of Ameri-
can  big  business.  Exploiting  the  continent’s  vast
resources,  vertically  integrated  corporations  emerged
as  the  dominant business form, and giant companies
built near monopolies in some sectors of the economy.
Corporations devised new modes of production, dis-
tribution,  and  marketing,  extending  their  reach
through the department store, the mail-order catalog,
and the new advertising industry. These developments
laid the groundwork for mass consumer culture. They
also offered emerging jobs in management, sales, and
office work.

Rapid  industrialization  drew  immigrants  from
around the world. Until the 1920s, most European and
Latin  American  immigrants  were  welcome  to  enter

the  United  States,  though  they  often  endured  harsh
conditions  after  they  arrived.  Asian  immigrants,  by
contrast,  faced  severe  discrimination.  The  Chinese
Exclusion Act blocked all Chinese laborers from com-
ing to the United States; it was later extended to other
Asians,  and  it  built  the  legal  framework  for  broader
forms of exclusion.

Nationwide movements for workers’ rights arose in
response  to  industrialization.  During  the  1870s  and
1880s, coalitions of workers and farmers, notably the
Knights  of  Labor  and  the  Farmers’  Alliance,  sought
political solutions to what they saw as  large corpora-
tions’  exploitation  of  working  people.  Pressure  from
such  movements  led  to  the  first  major  attempts  to
regulate  corporations,  such  as  the  federal  Interstate
Commerce  Act.  Radical  protest  movements  were
weakened,  however,  after  public  condemnation  of
anarchist  violence  in  1886  at  Chicago’s  Haymarket
Square. Meanwhile, trade unions such as the American
Federation  of  Labor  organized  skilled  workers  and
negotiated directly with employers, becoming the most
popular form of labor organization in the early twenti-
eth century.
