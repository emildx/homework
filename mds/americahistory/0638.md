National Parks and Forests, 1872–1980

Yellowstone, the ﬁrst national park in the United States, dates from 1872. In 1893, the federal
government began to intervene to protect national forests. Without Theodore Roosevelt, how-
ever, the national forest program might have languished; during his presidency, he added 125
million acres to the forest system, plus six national parks in addition to several that had already
been created during the 1890s. America’s national forest and park systems remain one of the
most visible and beloved legacies of federal policy innovation in the decades between the Civil
War and World War I.

As  early  as  the  late  1880s,  the  lakes  and  hiking  trails
of  the  Catskill  Mountains  became  so  thronged  with
working-class  tourists  from  nearby  New  York  City,
including  many  Jewish  immigrants,  that  elite  visitors
began to segregate themselves into gated summer com-
munities. They thus preserved the “seclusion and pri-
vacy” that they snobbishly claimed as the privilege of
those  who  could  demonstrate  “mental  and  personal
worth.”

At the state level, meanwhile, new game laws trig-
gered conflicts between elite conservationists and the
poor. Shifting from year-round subsistence hunting to
a  limited,  recreational  hunting  season  brought  hard-
ship to poor rural families who depended on game for
food. Regulation brought undeniable benefits: it sup-
pressed  such  popular  practices  as  songbird  hunting
and the use of dynamite to kill fish. Looking back on
the era before game laws, one Alabama hunter remem-
bered that “the slaughter was terrific.” But while game
laws  prevented  further  extinctions  like  that  of  the

passenger  pigeon,  which  vanished  around  1900,  they
made it harder for rural people to support themselves
from the bounty of the land.

Women, Men, and the
Solitude of Self
Speaking to Congress in 1892, women’s rights advocate
Elizabeth Cady Stanton described what she called the
“solitude of self.” Stanton rejected the claim that women
did not need equal rights because they enjoyed men’s
protection.  “The  talk  of  sheltering  woman  from  the
fierce  storms  of  life  is  the  sheerest  mockery,”  she
declared.  “They  beat  on  her  from  every  point  of  the
compass, just as they do on man, and with more fatal
results, for he has been trained to protect himself.”

Stanton’s argument captured one of the dilemmas
of industrialization: the marketplace of labor brought
