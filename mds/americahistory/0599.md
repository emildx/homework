Marianna Mine Disaster  The bituminous mines of Marianna, Pennsylvania, and many other rich
sites provided the coal that fueled American industrial growth. On November 28, 1908, an explosion
in the mine killed 158 workers. Many were American-born; some were Irish, Welsh, Italian, and Polish
immigrants. Here, a horse-drawn wagon carries bodies recovered from the mine. Such catastrophes laid
bare the human cost of industrialization. Marianna was one among many: in the same decade, disasters
at Scoﬁeld, Utah; Jacobs Creek, Pennsylvania; Monongah, West Virginia; and Cherry, Illinois, each killed
over 200 men. Library of Congress.
