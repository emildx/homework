MAP 20.1
The Presidential Elections of 1880, 1884, and 1888

The anatomy of hard-fought, narrowly won presidential
campaigns is evident in this trio of electoral maps. First,
note the equal division of the popular vote between
Republicans and Democrats. Second, note the persistent
pattern of electoral votes, as states overwhelmingly went
to the same party in all three elections. Here, we can
identify who determined the outcomes — “swing” states,
such as New York and Indiana, whose vote shifted every
four years and always in favor of the winning candidate.

Civil service laws had their downside. In the race
for  government  jobs,  they  tilted  the  balance  toward
middle-class  applicants  who  could  perform  well  on
tests.  “Firemen  now  must  know  equations,”  com-
plained a critic, “and be up on Euclid too.” But the laws
put  talented  professionals  in  office  and  discouraged
politicians  from  appointing  unqualified  party  hacks.
The civil service also brought stability and consistency
to  government,  since  officials  did  not  lose  their  jobs
every time their party lost power. In the long run, civil
service laws markedly reduced corruption.

Leaders  of  the  civil  service  movement  included
many  classical  liberals  (Chapter  15):  former  Repub-
licans who became disillusioned with Reconstruction
and  advocated  smaller,  more  professionalized  gov-
ernment.  Many  had  opposed  President  Ulysses  S.
Grant’s reelection in 1872. In 1884, they again left the
Republican  Party  because  they  could  not  stomach
its  scandal-tainted  candidate,  James  Blaine.  Liberal
Repub li cans — ridiculed  by  their  enemies  as  Mug-
wumps  (fence-sitters  who  had  their  “mugs”  on  one
side and their “wumps” on the other) — helped elect
Democrat Grover Cleveland. They believed he shared
their vision of smaller government.

As president, Cleveland showed that he largely did
share their views. He vetoed, for example, thousands of
bills providing pensions for individual Union veterans.
But in 1887, responding to pressure from farmer-labor
advocates  in  the  Democratic  Party  who  demanded
action to limit corporate power, he signed the Interstate
Commerce Act (Chapter 17). At the same time, munic-
ipal  and  state-level  initiatives  were  showing  how
expanded  government  could  help  solve  industrial
problems.  In  the  1870s  and  early  1880s,  many  states
created Bureaus of Labor Statistics to investigate work-
place safety and unemployment. Some appointed com-
missions  to  oversee  key  industries,  from  banking  to
dairy  farming.  By  later  standards,  such  commissions
were  underfunded,  but  even  when  they  lacked  legal
