  INDUSTRIALIZING AMERICA: UPHEAVALS AND EXPERIMENTS, 1877–1917

Robert M. La Follette

La Follette was transformed into a political reformer when, in 1891, a Wisconsin Republican boss attempted
to bribe him to inﬂuence a judge in a railway case. As he described it in his autobiography, “Out of this awful
ordeal came understanding; and out of understanding came resolution. I determined that the power of this
corrupt inﬂuence . . . should be broken.” This photograph captures him at the top of his form, expounding
his progressive vision to a rapt audience of Wisconsin citizens at an impromptu street gathering. Library of

necessary  for  men.”  This  conclusion  dismayed  labor
advocates  and  divided  female  reformers  for  decades
afterward.

Male  workers  did  benefit,  however,  from  new
workmen’s  compensation  measures.  Between  1910
and  1917,  all  the  industrial  states  enacted  insurance
laws covering on-the-job accidents, so workers’ fami-
lies would not starve if a breadwinner was injured or
killed.  Some  states  also  experimented  with  so-called
mothers’  pensions,  providing  state  assistance  after  a
breadwinner’s  desertion  or  death.  Mothers,  however,
were  subjected  to  home  visits  to  determine  whether
they  “deserved”  government  aid;  injured  workmen
were not judged on this basis, a pattern of gender dis-
crimination that reflected the broader impulse to pro-
tect women, while also treating them differently from
men. Mothers’ pensions reached relatively small num-
bers  of  women,  but  they  laid  foundations  for  the
national  program  Aid  to  Families  with  Dependent
Children,  an  important  component  of  the  Social
Security Act of 1935.

While federalism gave the states considerable free-
dom  to  innovate,  it  hampered  national  reforms.  In

some states, for example, opponents of child labor won
laws  barring  young  children  from  factory  work  and
strictly regulating hours and conditions for older chil-
dren’s labor. In the South, however, and in coal-mining
states  like  Pennsylvania,  companies  fiercely  resisted
such  laws — as  did  many  working-class  parents  who
relied  on  children’s  income  to  keep  the  family  fed.  A
proposed  U.S.  constitutional  amendment  to  abolish
child  labor  never  won  ratification;  only  four  states
passed it. Tens of thousands of children continued to
work  in  low-wage  jobs,  especially  in  the  South.  The
same  decentralized  power  that  permitted  innovation
in Wisconsin hampered the creation of national mini-
mum standards for pay and job safety.

The  Birth  of  Modern  Civil  Rights  Reeling  from
disenfranchisement and the sanction of racial segrega-
tion  in  Plessy  v.  Ferguson  (1896),  African  American
leaders faced distinctive challenges. Given the obvious
deterioration of African American rights, a new gener-
ation of black leaders proposed bolder approaches than
those  popularized  earlier  by  Booker  T.  Washington.
