An Emblem of America, 1800
searched for a symbolic representation of their new nation. This engraving shows many of the choices:
Should the symbol of “America” have an ideological meaning, as in the Goddess of Liberty? Or should it
enshrine national heroes, as in the stone Memorial to Washington? Or should America’s symbol be found
among its unique features, such as Niagara Falls (pictured in the background) or the presence of Africans
and Indians (as represented by the black youth to the right and the spear-brandishing ﬁgure in front of
the falls)? Or, ﬁnally, should its symbol be the national ﬂag? Courtesy of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University.
