English Tobacco Label, c. 1700  This label, which was used to advertise Virginia tobacco to London consumers,
illustrates the growth of plantation economies in North America. Three well-to-do planters, bewigged and dressed
in fashionable, colorful coats, take their ease with pipes of tobacco and glasses of liquor while slaves labor for them
in the ﬁelds. The product’s name — London’s Virginia — highlights the relationship between production on colonial
plantations and consumption in the English metropolis. The Granger Collection, New York.
