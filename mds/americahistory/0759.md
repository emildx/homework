Celebrating the Fourth of July, 1926  This Life magazine cover celebrates two famous symbols
of the 1920s: jazz music and the “ﬂapper,” in her droopy tights and scandalously short skirt, who loves
to dance to its rhythms. The ﬂags at the top record the latest slang expressions, including “so’s your
old man” and “step on it” (“it” being the accelerator of an automobile, in a decade when cars were
America’s hottest commodity). The bottom of the picture also added a note of protest: while July 4,
1926, marked the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Life says that Americans have
had only “one hundred and forty-three years of liberty” — followed by “seven years of Prohibition.”
