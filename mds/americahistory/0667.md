MAP 19.1
The Lower East Side, New York City,
1900

As this map shows, the Jewish immi-
grants dominating Manhattan’s
Lower East Side preferred to live in
neighborhoods populated by those

Europe. Their sense of a common

ﬂowering of educational, cultural,
and social institutions on the Jewish
East Side. Ethnic neighborhoods
became a feature of almost every
American city.

which sprang up to the east. Though ethnically diverse,
East Los Angeles was resolutely working class; middle-
class white neighborhoods grew up predominantly in
West Los Angeles.

African  Americans  also  sought  urban  opportuni-
ties. In 1900, almost 90 percent of American blacks still
lived in the South, but increasing numbers had moved
to cities such as Baton Rouge, Jacksonville, Montgom-
ery,  and  Charleston,  all  of  whose  populations  were

more  than  50  percent  African  American.  Blacks  also
settled in northern cities, albeit not in the numbers that
would  arrive  during  the  Great  Migration  of  World
War I. Though blacks constituted
only 2 percent of New York City’s
