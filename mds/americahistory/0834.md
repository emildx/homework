  DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL CHALLENGES, 1890–1945

Wartime Civil Rights

Fighting fascism abroad while
battling racism at home was
the approach taken by black
communities across the country
during World War II. Securing
democracy in Europe and Asia
while not enjoying it in the
United States did not seem just.
Jobs were plentiful as the war-
time economy hummed along
at a fevered pitch. But when
employers and unions kept Jim
Crow hiring policies in place,
African Americans did not hesi-
tate to protest. Here picketers

discrimination  in  the  United  States,  black  leaders
waged the Double V campaign: calling for victory over
Nazism abroad and racism at home. “This is a war for
freedom. Whose freedom?” the renowned black leader
W.  E.  B.  Du  Bois  asked.  If  it  meant  “the  freedom  of
Negroes  in  the  Southern  United  States,”  Du  Bois
answered, “my gun is on my shoulder.”

Even before Pearl Harbor, black labor activism was
on  the  rise.  In  1940,  only  240  of  the  nation’s  100,000
aircraft  workers  were  black,  and  most  of  them  were
janitors. African American leaders demanded that the
government require defense contractors to hire more
black  workers.  When  Washington  took  no  action,
A. Philip Randolph, head of the Brotherhood of Sleep-
ing  Car  Porters,  the  largest  black  labor  union  in  the
country, announced plans for a march on Washington
in the summer of 1941.

Roosevelt  was  not  a  strong  supporter  of  African
American  equality,  but  he  wanted  to  avoid  public
protest  and  a  disruption  of  the
nation’s  war  preparations.  So  the
president  made  a  deal:  he  issued
Executive  Order  8802,  and  in
June 1941 Randolph canceled the
march. The order prohibited “dis-
crimination  in  the  employment
of  workers  in  defense  industries
or  government  because  of  race,

creed, color, or national origin” and established the Fair
Employment  Practices  Commission  (FEPC).  Mary
McLeod Bethune called the wartime FEPC “a  refresh-
ing shower in a thirsty land.” This federal commitment
to  black  employment  rights  was  unprecedented  but
limited:  it  did  not  affect  segregation  in  the  armed
forces,  and  the  FEPC  could  not  enforce  compliance
with its orders.

Nevertheless,  wartime  developments

laid  the
ground work for the civil rights revolution of the 1960s.
The  NAACP  grew  ninefold,  to  450,000  members,  by
1945.  In  Chicago,  James  Farmer  helped  to  found  the
Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1942, a group
that  would  become  known  nationwide  in  the  1960s
for its direct action protests such as sit-ins. The FEPC
inspired  black  organizing  against  employment  dis-
crimination  in  hundreds  of  cities  and  workplaces.
Behind  this  combination  of  government  action  and
black  militancy,  the  civil  rights  movement  would
advance on multiple fronts in the postwar years.

Mexican Americans, too, challenged long-standing
practices of discrimination and exclusion. Throughout
much of the Southwest, it was still common for signs to
read “No Mexicans Allowed,” and Mexican American
workers  were  confined  to  menial,  low-paying  jobs.
Several organizations, including the League of United
Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Congress of
Spanish  Speaking  Peoples,  pressed  the  government
