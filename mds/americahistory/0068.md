Altered Landscapes

In the eastern woodlands, Native Americans set ﬁres once or twice a year to clear
underbrush and open up landscapes that would otherwise have been densely
wooded. The burnings made it easier to plant corn, beans, and squash and drew
big game animals into the clearings, where hunters could fell them. As European
colonization  displaced  Indian  populations,  this  practice  ended.  Some  scholars
have even suggested that the decline in burning caused a drop of carbon in the
atmosphere large enough to account for the Little Ice Age, an episode of global
cooling that lasted from about 1550 to 1850, though the claim is controversial.

Thomas Morton, Of the Custome in burning the
Country, and the reason thereof (1637)

The Savages are accustomed to set fire of the Country in
all places where they come, and to burne it twize a yeare,
viz: at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The reason that
mooves them to doe so, is because it would other wise be
so overgrowne with underweedes that it would be all a
coppice wood, and the people would not be able in any
wise to passe through the Country out of a beaten path.

The meanes that they do it with, is with certaine min-

erall stones, that they carry about them in baggs made
for that purpose of the skinnes of little beastes, which
they convert into good lether, carrying in the same a
peece of touch wood, very excellent for that purpose,
of their owne making. These minerall stones they have
from the Piquenteenes, (which is to the Southward of all
the plantations in New England,) by trade and trafficke
with those people.

The burning of the grasse destroyes the underwoods,
and so scorcheth the elder trees that it shrinkes them, and
hinders their grouth very much: so that hee that will looke
to finde large trees and good tymber, must not depend
upon the help of a woodden prospect to finde them on
the uplandground; but must seeke for them, (as I and oth-
ers have done,) in the lower grounds, where the grounds
are wett, when the Country is fired, by reason of the snow
water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by
continuance of that hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth,
and dried up those places where the fire, (by reason of the
moisture,) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and
if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars,
hee must not seeke for them on the higher grounds, but
make his inquest for them in the vallies, for the Savages,

by this custome of theirs, have spoiled all the rest: for this
custome hath bin continued from the beginninge.

And least their firing of the Country in this manner
should be an occasion of damnifying us, and indaingering
our habitations, wee our selves have used carefully about
the same times to observe the winds, and fire the grounds
about our owne habitations; to prevent the Dammage that
might happen by any neglect thereof, if the fire should
come neere those howses in our absence.

For, when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and

spreads it selfe as well against, as with the winde; burning
continually night and day, untill a shower of raine falls to
quench it.

And this custome of firing the Country is the meanes

to make it passable; and by that meanes the trees growe
here and there as in our parks: and makes the Country
very beautifull and commodious.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  What beneﬁts and dangers does Morton attribute to the
practice of Indian burning? How did he and his fellow
colonists respond to the practice?

2.  Since Europeans did not practice widespread burning

in the Indian manner, they achieved deforestation only
slowly, through many years of backbreaking labor. Think-
ing comparatively about European and Native American
approaches to landscape management, how would you
assess the beneﬁts and challenges of each approach?
