In the wake of the Declaration of Independence, General William

The Great New York Fire of 1776
Howe’s ﬁrst objective was to capture New York, with its strategic location and excellent harbor. Patriot
forces under George Washington’s command attempted to defend the city but were forced into retreat
and abandoned it to the British in September 1776. Early in the morning of September 21, a ﬁre broke
out near the southern tip of Manhattan and burned northwestward, driven by a strong wind. As many
as a quarter of the town’s buildings were destroyed; residents, already distressed by the ﬁghting, ﬂed
into the streets with whatever possessions they could carry. Each side accused the other of arson, but that
charge was never proven. Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs, The New York Public Library. Astor, Lenox
