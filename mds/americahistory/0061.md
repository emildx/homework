Village of Secoton, 1585   English colonist John White painted this view of an Algonquian village on
the outer banks of present-day North Carolina. Its cluster of houses surrounded by ﬁelds of crops closely
resembled European farming communities of the same era. White captured everyday details of the town’s
social life, including food preparation and a ceremony or celebration in progress (lower right). Service
