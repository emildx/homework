Celebrating the Fifteenth Amendment, 1870  This lithograph depicts a celebration in Baltimore
on May 15, 1870. With perhaps 200,000 people attending, the grand parade and orations marked
passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which enfranchised men irrespective of “race, color, or previous
condition of servitude.” The heroes depicted at the top are Martin Delany, the first black man to become
an officer in the U.S. Army; abolitionist Frederick Douglass, born in slavery on Maryland’s eastern shore;
and Mississippi senator Hiram Rhodes Revels. The images at the bottom carried the following captions:
“Liberty Protects the Marriage Altar,” “The Ballot Box is open to us,” and “Our representative Sits in the
National Legislature.” Such lithographs, widely printed and sold, capture the pride, hope, and optimism
of Reconstruction — but the optimism was not to last. Library of Congress.
