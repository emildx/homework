Chapter 2
American Experiments, 1521–1700  40

How did the political,
economic, and religious
systems of Native Americans,
Europeans, and Africans
compare, and how did things
change as a result of contacts
among them?

In what ways did European
migrants transfer familiar
patterns and institutions to
their colonies in the Americas,
and in what ways did they
create new American worlds?
How did Native Americans
adapt to the growing presence
of Europeans among them?
