Independent nations of the Third World,

MAP 27.5
Decolonization and the Third World, 1943–1990

In the decades after World War II, African nations threw off the yoke of European colonialism.
Some new nations, such as Ghana, the former British colony of Gold Coast, achieved indepen-
dence rather peacefully. Others, such as Algeria and Mozambique, did so only after bloody
anticolonial wars. American civil rights activists watched African decolonization with great
enthusiasm, seeing the two struggles as linked. “Sure we identiﬁed with the blacks in Africa,”
civil rights leader John Lewis said. “Here were black people, talking of freedom and liberation
and independence thousands of miles away.” In 1960 alone, the year that student sit-ins swept
across the American South, more than a dozen African nations gained independence.

organizing produced a generation of leaders (many of
whom later went into politics) and awakened commu-
nity consciousness.

The New Urban Politics  Black Power also inspired
African Americans to work within the political system.
By the mid-1960s, black residents neared 50 percent of
the population in several major American cities — such
as  Atlanta,  Cleveland,  Detroit,  and  Washington,  D.C.
Black Power in these cities was not abstract; it counted
in real votes. Residents of Gary, Indiana, and Cleveland,
Ohio,  elected  the  first  black  mayors  of  large  cities  in
1967.  Richard  Hatcher  in  Gary  and  Carl  Stokes  in
Cleveland  helped  forge  a  new  urban  politics  in  the
United States. Their campaign teams registered thou-
sands of black voters and made alliances with enough
whites to create a working majority. Many saw Stokes’s
victory, in particular, as heralding a new day. As one of
Stokes’s  campaign  staffers  said:  “If  Carl  Stokes  could
run  for  mayor  in  the  eighth  largest  city  in  America,
then  maybe  who  knows.  We  could  be  senators.  We
could be anything we wanted.”

Having  met  with  some  political  success,  black
leaders gathered in Gary for the 1972 National Black
Political Convention. In a meeting that brought together
radicals,  liberals,  and  centrists,  debate  centered  on
whether to form a third political party. Hatcher recalled
that many in attendance believed that “there was going
to  be  a  black  third  party.”  In  the  end,  however,  dele-
gates decided to “give the Democratic Party one more
chance.” Instead of creating a third party, the conven-
tion issued the National Black Political Agenda, which
included  calls  for  community  control  of  schools  in
black  neighborhoods,  national  health  insurance,  and
the elimination of the death penalty.

Democrats  failed  to  enact  the  National  Black
Political Agenda, but African Americans were increas-
ingly  integrated  into  American  political  institutions.
By  the  end  of  the  century,  black  elected  officials  had
become commonplace in major American cities. There
were forty-seven African American big-city mayors by
the 1990s, and blacks had led most of the nation’s most
prominent cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Ange-
les,  New  York,  Philadelphia,  and  Washington,  D.C.
