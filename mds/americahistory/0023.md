Chapter 8
Creating a Republican Culture,
1790–1820  248

What was required to make
the United States a strong,
viable, independent republic in
its early years, and how did
debates over the Constitution
shape relations between the
national government and the
states?

In eighteenth-century Europe,
the leading principles were
aristocracy, patriarchy,
mercantilism, arranged
marriages, legal privilege, and
established churches. What
principles would replace those
societal rules in America’s new
republican society?
