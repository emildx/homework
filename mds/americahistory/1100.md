themselves;  they  shall  name  in  their  ballots  the  person
voted  for  as  President,  and  in  distinct  ballots  the  person
voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct
lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons
voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for
each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit

Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall
then be counted; — The person having the greatest number
of votes for President, shall be the President, if such num-
ber  be  a  majority  of  the  whole  number  of  Electors
appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from

of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the
President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be
taken by States, the representation from each State having
one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a mem-
ber or members from two-thirds of the States, and a major-
ity of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. And if the
House  of  Representatives  shall  not  choose  a  President
whenever  the  right  of  choice  shall  devolve  upon  them,
before  the  fourth  day  of  March  next  following,  then  the
Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the
death or other constitutional disability of the President.* —

no person have a majority, then from the two highest num-
bers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President;
a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the
whole  number  of  Senators,  and  a  majority  of  the  whole
number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person con-
stitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eli-
gible to that of Vice-President of the United States.
