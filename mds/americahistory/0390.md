Becoming Literate:

Public Education and

Democracy

The struggle for a genuinely democratic polity — “government of the people, by
the people, and for the people,” as Lincoln put it — played out at the local and
state level in battles over who should participate in the political arena. As legis-
lators argued over extending the franchise, they considered the knowledge that
citizens needed to participate responsibly in politics. Although primary educa-
tion  was  publicly  supported  in  most  New  England  towns  (giving  that  region
nearly universal literacy), it received only spotty funding in the other northern
states and almost none in the South (restricting literacy there to one-third of the
white population). The following documents address the resulting debate over
publicly supported education and citizenship.

1.  Editorial from the Philadelphia National Gazette,

1830. Pennsylvania was one of the ﬁrst states to
debate legislation regarding universal free public
education.

The scheme of Universal Equal Education . . . is virtually
“Agrarianism” [redistribution of land from rich to poor].
It would be a compulsory application of the means of the
richer, for the direct use of the poorer classes. . . . One of
the chief excitements to industry . . . is the hope of earn-
ing the means of educating their children respectably . . .
that incentive would be removed, and the scheme of state
and equal education be a premium for comparative idle-
ness, to be taken out of the pockets of the laborious and
conscientious.

2.  Thaddeus Stevens, speech before the Penn sylvania
General Assembly, February 1835. Pennsylvania’s
Free Public School Act of 1834 was the handiwork
of the Working Men’s Party of Philadelphia (see
p. 334). When over half of Pennsylvania’s school
districts refused to implement the law, the legisla-
ture threatened to repeal it. Thaddeus Stevens,
later a leading antislavery advocate, turned back
that threat through this speech to the Pennsylva-
nia General Assembly.

It would seem to be humiliating to be under the necessity,
in the nineteenth century, of entering into a formal argu-
ment to prove the utility, and to free governments, the
absolute necessity of education. . . . Such necessity would
be degrading to a Christian age and a free republic. If an
elective republic is to endure for any great length of time,
every elector must have sufficient information, not only
to accumulate wealth and take care of his pecuniary
concerns, but to direct wisely the Legislatures, the
Ambas sadors, and the Executive of the nation; for
some part of all these things, some agency in approv-
ing or disapproving of them, falls to every freeman. If,

then, the permanency of our government depends upon
such knowledge, it is the duty of government to see that
the means of information be diffused to every citizen.
This is a sufficient answer to those who deem education
a private and not a public duty — who argue that they are
willing to educate their own children, but not their neigh-
bor’s children.

3.  “Letter from a Teacher” in Catharine E. Beecher,

The True Remedy for the Wrongs of Women, 1851.
The public school movement created new oppor-
tunities not just for children of middle and lower
classes but also for the young Protestant women
who contributed to the “Benevolent Empire” as
professional educators. Beecher’s academy (see
p. 369) in Hartford, Connecticut, sent out dozens
of young women to establish schools.

I am now located in this place, which is the county-town
of a newly organized county [in a midwestern state]. . . .
The Sabbath is little regarded, and is more a day for diver-
sion than devotion. . . . My school embraces both sexes
and all ages from five to seventeen, and not one can read
intelligibly.

4.  “Popular Education,” 1833. This piece appeared in
the North American Review, the nation’s ﬁrst liter-
ary and cultural journal and the mouthpiece of
New England’s intellectual elite.

[T]he mind of a people, in proportion as it is educated,
will not only feel its own value, but will also perceive its
rights. We speak now of those palpable rights which are
recognised by all free states. . . . [T]he palpable rights of
men, those of personal security, of property and of the
free and unembarrassed pursuit of individual welfare,
it is obviously impossible to conceal from an educated
and reading people. Such a people rises at once above the
condition of feudal tenants. . . . It directs its attention to
