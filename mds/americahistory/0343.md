The Fate of the

American and Indian

Textile Industries

In  1776,  the  United  States  declared  its  independence  from  the  British  Empire.
About the same time, Britain began to create in India what historians call the
Second British Empire. By 1860, Britain had become the world’s leading indus-
trial economy and dominated the princely states and peoples of the Indian sub-
continent.  The  following  tables  trace  the  impact  of  political  decisions  on  the
American  and  Indian  textile  industries.  As  the  legislature  of  an  independent
republic,  the  U.S.  Congress  could  impose  tariffs  (taxes  on  imported  goods)  on
British textiles; as colonies, Indian governments could not do so.

1Entries in Spindle column are the average per year across the decade; i.e., there were perhaps 100,000 spindles in 1810 and 350,000 in 1820,
yielding an average of 215,000 between 1810 and 1819.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  Compare changes in Indian production (“Production for
Domestic Consumption” and “Exports to Britain”) with
changes in American production (“Number of Cotton
Mill Workers” and “Number of Spindles”) between
1800 and 1861. Which country is “industrializing,” and
which is “deindustrializing”?

2.  How do American tariffs change over time? (Chapter 10
will explain the reasons for these changes.) What is the
impact of American tariff rates on the import of British
textiles?

3.  What insights does this material provide into the politi-
cal and economic aspects of American industrialization?
