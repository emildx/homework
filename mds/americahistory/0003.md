About the cover image

The Sources of Country Music

In painting this vibrant work, artist Thomas Hart Benton captured many of the forces
that shaped America. A preacher and hymn singers emphasize the importance of
religious faith to both women and men. Fiddle players—with a decidedly less sacred
outlook—keep a jug of whiskey on hand. A man playing the African-derived banjo
represents the profound inﬂuence of African Americans on the nation’s culture. In the
background, a steamboat and locomotive show the transformative role of technology
and economic change.
