MAP 20.4
The Presidential Elections of 1892 and 1896

In the 1890s, the age of political stalemate came to
an end. Students should compare the 1892 map with
Map 20.1 (p. 639) and note especially Cleveland’s
breakthrough in the normally Republican states of the
Upper Midwest. In 1896, the pendulum swung in the
opposite direction, with McKinley’s consolidation of
Republican control over the Northeast and Midwest far
overbalancing the Democratic advances in the thinly
populated western states. The 1896 election marked the
beginning of sixteen years of Republican dominance in
national politics.

Having  excluded  or  reduced  the  number  of  poor,
African  American,  and  immigrant  voters,  elite  and

William Jennings Bryan

This 1896 campaign poster emphasizes the youth of the
thirty-six-year-old Nebraska Democrat and includes portraits
of his wife Mary and their three young children. The full text

ver coins and overlaid with “16 to 1,” representing the
Chicago platform’s proposal to mint U.S. silver coins at a
16-to-1 ratio with gold, increasing the money supply to stim-
ulate the economy and aid borrowers. At the bottom stand a
farmer and industrial workingman — primary bases of
Democratic support. Many farmers and workers voted for
McKinley, however, especially in the industrial heartland of
the Northeast and Midwest. Though Bryan secured the elec-
toral votes of the South and a substantial majority of western
states, McKinley won the election. Library of Congress.

voters,”  many  northern  states  imposed  literacy  tests
and restrictions on immigrant voting. Leaders of both
major parties, determined to prevent future Populist-
style  threats,  made  it  more  difficult  for  new  parties
to  get  candidates  listed  on  the  ballot.  In  the  wake  of
such  laws,  voter  turnout  declined,  and  the  electorate
narrowed  in  ways  that  favored  the  native-born  and
wealthy.

Antidemocratic restrictions on voting helped, par-
adoxically,  to  foster  certain  democratic  innovations.
