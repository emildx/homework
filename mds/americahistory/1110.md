*Note: Until 1890, census takers never made any effort to count the Native American people who lived outside their reserved political areas and com-
piled only casual and incomplete enumerations of those living within their jurisdictions. In 1890, the federal government attempted a full count of the
Indian population: the Census found 125,719 Indians in 1890, compared with only 12,543 in 1870 and 33,985 in 1880.
