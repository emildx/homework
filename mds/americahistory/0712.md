Theodore Roosevelt:

From Anti-Populist to

New Nationalist

Theodore Roosevelt published the ﬁrst piece below in a leading journal in 1897.
At the time he was serving as police commissioner of New York City. The second
document is a famous speech he delivered in 1910, when he had retired from
the presidency but was planning a bid for the 1912 Republican nomination.

“How Not to Help Our Poorer Brother,” 1897

In the 1890s Roosevelt, a rising Republican star, forcefully
denounced  populism  and  other  radical  movements.  The
comments below were part of an exchange with Populists’
1896 vice-presidential nominee, Tom Watson of Georgia.

There are plenty of ugly things about wealth and its pos-
sessors in the present age, and I suppose there have been
in all ages. There are many rich people who so utterly lack
patriotism, or show such sordid and selfish traits of char-
acter, . . . that all right-minded men must look upon them
with angry contempt; but, on the whole, the thrifty are apt
to be better citizens than the thriftless; and the worst capi-
talist cannot harm laboring men as they are harmed by
demagogues. . . .

The first lesson to teach the poor man is that, as a
whole, the wealth of the community is distinctly benefi-
cial to him; that he is better off in the long run because
other men are well off, and that the surest way to destroy
what measure of prosperity he may have is to paralyze
industry and the well-being of those men who have
achieved success.

. . . It may become necessary to interfere even more
than we have done with the right of private contract, and
to shackle cunning as we have shackled force. All I insist
upon is that we must be sure of our ground before trying
to get any legislation, and that we must not expect too
much from this legislation. . . . The worst foe of the
poor man is the labor leader, whether philanthropist
or politician, who tried to teach him that he is a victim
of conspiracy and injustice, when in reality he is merely
working out his fate with blood and sweat as the immense
majority of men who are worthy of the name always have
done and always will have to do. . . .

Something can be done by good laws; more can be
done by honest administration of the laws; but most of
all can be done by frowning resolutely upon the preachers
of vague discontent; and by upholding the true doctrine
of self-reliance, self-help, and self-mastery. This doctrine
sets forth many things. Among them is that, though a
man can occasionally be helped when he stumbles, yet

that it is useless to try to carry him when he will not or
cannot walk; and worse than useless to try to bring down
the work and reward of the thrifty and intelligent to the
level of the capacity of the weak, the shiftless, and the
idle. . . .

If an American is to amount to anything he must rely
upon himself, and not upon the State. . . . It is both fool-
ish and wicked to teach the average man who is not well
off that some wrong or injustice has been done him, and
that he should hope for redress elsewhere than in his own
industry, honesty and intelligence.

New Nationalism Speech, August 31, 1910

Roosevelt  delivered  this  speech  to  a  gathering  of  Union
veterans  at  Osawatomie,  Kansas,  a  site  associated  with
abolitionist  John  Brown  (Chapter  13).  Why  do  you  think
Roosevelt chose this occasion and audience?

Of that [Civil War] generation of men to whom we owe
so much, the man to whom we owe most is, of course,
Lincoln. Part of our debt to him is because he forecast
our present struggle and saw the way out. He said:

. . . “Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital.
Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have
existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior
of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.”
If that remark was original with me, I should be even
more strongly denounced as a Communist agitator than
I shall be anyhow. It is Lincoln’s. I am only quoting it; and
that is one side; that is the side the capitalist should hear.
Now, let the working man hear his side.

“Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protec-
tion as any other rights. . . . Nor should this lead to a war
upon the owners of property. Property is the fruit of
labor; property is desirable.”

. . . It seems to me that, in these words, Lincoln took
substantially the attitude that we ought to take; he showed
the proper sense of proportion in his relative estimates
of capital and labor, of human rights and property rights.
One of the chief factors in progress is the destruction of
special privilege. The essence of any struggle for healthy
