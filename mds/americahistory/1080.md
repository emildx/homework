  GLOBAL CAPITALISM AND THE END OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY, 1980 TO THE PRESENT

consent, virtually a copresident. Bush also brought into
the  administration  his  campaign  advisor,  Karl  Rove,
whose  advice  made  for  an  exceptionally  politicized
White House. Rove foreclosed the easygoing centrism
of Bush the campaigner by arguing that a  permanent
Republican majority could be built on the party’s con-
servative  base.  On  Capitol  Hill,  Rove’s  hard  line  was
reinforced by Tom DeLay, the House majority leader,
who in 1995 had declared “all-out war” on the Demo-
crats.  To  win  that  war,  DeLay  pushed  congressional
Republicans to endorse a fierce partisanship. The Senate,
although more collegial, went through a similar hard-
ening process. After 2002, with Republicans in control
of both Congress and the White House, bipartisan law-
making came to an end.

Tax  Cuts  The  domestic  issue  that  most  engaged
President  Bush,  as  it  had  Ronald  Reagan,  was  taxes.
Bush’s  Economic  Growth  and  Tax  Relief  Act  of  2001
had  something  for  everyone.  It  slashed  income  tax
rates, extended the earned income credit for the poor,
and marked the estate tax to be phased out by 2010. A
second round of cuts in 2003 targeted dividend income
and capital gains. Bush’s signature cuts — those favor-
ing  big  estates  and  well-to-do  owners  of  stocks  and
bonds — skewed the distribution of tax benefits upward
(Table 31.1). Bush had pushed far
beyond  any  other  postwar  presi-
dent,  even  Reagan,  in  slashing
federal taxes.

Critics warned that such mas-
sive  tax  cuts  would  plunge  the
federal government into debt. By
2006,  federal  expenditures  had

jumped 33 percent, at a faster clip than under any pres-
ident since Lyndon Johnson. Huge increases in health-
care costs were the main culprit. Two of the largest fed-
eral  programs,  Medicare  and  Medicaid — health  care
for the elderly and the poor, respectively — could not
contain  runaway  medical  costs.  Midway  through
Bush’s second term, the national debt stood at over $8
trillion — much of it owned by foreign investors, who
also financed the nation’s huge trade deficit. On top of
that,  staggering  Social  Security  and  Medicare  obliga-
tions  were  coming  due  for  retiring  baby  boomers.  It
seemed  that  these  burdens  would  be  passed  on  to
future generations (Figure 31.6).

September 11, 2001  How Bush’s presidency might
have fared in normal times is another of those unan-
swerable questions of history. As a candidate in 2000,
George W. Bush had said little about foreign policy. He
had assumed that his administration would rise or fall
on  his  domestic  program.  But  nine  months  into  his
presidency,  an  altogether  different  political  scenario
unfolded.  On  a  sunny  September  morning,  nineteen
Islamic  terrorists  from  Al  Qaeda  hijacked  four  com-
mercial jets and flew two of them into New York City’s
World  Trade  Center,  destroying  its  twin  towers  and
killing more than 2,900 people. A third plane crashed
into the Pentagon, near Washington, D.C. The fourth,
presumably  headed  for  the  White  House  or  possibly
the  U.S.  Capitol,  crashed  in  Pennsylvania  when  the
passengers fought back and thwarted the hijackers. As
an outburst of patriotism swept the United States in the
wake of the September 11 attacks, George W. Bush pro-
claimed a “war on terror” and vowed to carry the battle
to Al Qaeda.
