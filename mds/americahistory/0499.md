Fields of Death  Fought with mass armies and new weapons, the Civil War took a huge toll in human
lives, as evidenced by this grisly photograph of a small section of the battleﬁeld at Antietam, Maryland.
The most costly single-day battle in American history, it left 22,700 dead, wounded, and missing Con-
federate and Union soldiers. After the equally bloody three-day battle at Shiloh, Tennessee, in April
1862, General Ulysses Grant surveyed a ﬁeld “so covered with dead that it would have been possible to
walk . . . in any direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.” Library of Congress.
