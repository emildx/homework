the lands of the Louisiana Purchase at the southern boundary of
Missouri, with the exception of that state. (p. 269)

mixed government: John Adams’s theory from Thoughts on Gov-

regated bus system in 1955–1956 by the city’s African American

Court  declared  segregated  seating  on  public  transportation
unconstitutional. (p. 881)

moral  free  agency: The  doctrine  of  free  will  that  was  the  central

heaven was also within their grasp. (p. 306)

Muller v. Oregon: A 1908 Supreme Court case that upheld an Ore-
gon  law  limiting  women’s  workday  to  ten  hours,  based  on  the
need to protect women’s health for motherhood. Muller compli-

divided women’s  rights activists, however, because some saw its
provisions as discriminatory. (p. 652)

multiculturalism: The promotion of diversity in gender, race, eth-
