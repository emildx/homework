Economic Malaise in

the Seventies

Most major economic indicators in the United States turned downward in the
1970s, as the long postwar expansion ground to an unmistakable halt. The ﬁg-
ures below offer evidence of how developments in the United States compared
with other industrialized countries.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  In what ways do these ﬁgures demonstrate an inte-

grated global economy?

2.  What does the GDP graph indicate about how global
economic integration affected the U.S. economy?
Notice that Japan’s GDP growth remained strong in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. With what historical
development within the U.S. does that correspond?

residents  and  businesses  to  nearby  suburbs.  In  the
1970s alone, 13 million people (6 percent of the total
U.S. population) moved to the suburbs. New suburban
shopping  centers  opened  weekly  across  the  country,
and other businesses — such as banks, insurance com-
panies,  and  technology  firms — increasingly  sought
suburban locations. More and more, people lived and
worked  in  suburbs.  In  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area,
75  percent  of  all  daily  commutes  were  suburb-to-
suburb,  and  78  percent  of  New  York’s  suburban

residents worked in nearby suburbs. The 1950s “orga-
nization man,” commuting downtown from his subur-
ban home, had been replaced by the engineer, teacher,
nurse, student, and carpenter who lived in one suburb
and worked in another.

Beyond  city  limits,  suburbanization  and  the  eco-
nomic  crisis  combined  powerfully  in  what  became
known  as  the  tax  revolt,  a  dramatic  reversal  of  the
postwar spirit of generous public investment. The pre-
mier  example  was  California.  Inflation  pushed  real
