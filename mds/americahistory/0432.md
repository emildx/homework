  OVERLAPPING REVOLUTIONS, 1800–1860

The Domestic Slave Trade
In  1817,  when  the  American  Colonization  Society
began to transport a few freed blacks to Africa (Chap-
ter 8), the southern plantation system was expanding
rapidly. In 1790, its western boundary ran through the
middle of Georgia; by 1830, it stretched through west-
ern Louisiana; by 1860, the slave frontier extended far
into Texas (Map 12.1). That advance of 900 miles more
than doubled the geographical area cultivated by slave
labor  and  increased  the  number  of  slave  states  from
eight  in  1800  to  fifteen  by  1850.  The  federal  govern-
ment played a  key role in this expansion. It acquired
Louisiana from the French in 1803, welcomed the slave
states  of  Mississippi  and  Alabama  into  the  Union  in
1817  and  1819,  removed  Native  Americans  from  the
southeastern  states  in  the  1830s,  and  annexed  Texas
and Mexican lands in the 1840s.

To cultivate this vast area, white planters imported
enslaved laborers first from Africa and then from the
Chesapeake region. Between 1776 and 1809, when Con-
gress  outlawed  the  Atlantic  slave  trade,  planters  pur-
chased  about  115,000  Africans.  “The  Planter  will . . .
Sacrifice  every  thing  to  attain Negroes,”  declared  one
slave trader. Despite the influx, the demand for labor
far exceeded the supply. Consequently, planters imported
new  African  workers  illegally,  through  the  Spanish
colony  of  Florida  until  1819  and  then  through  the
Mexican province of Texas. Yet these Africans — about
50,000  between  1810  and  1865 — did  not  satisfy  the
demand.

The Upper South Exports Slaves
Planters  seeking  labor  looked  to  the  Chesapeake
region, home in 1800 to nearly half of the nation’s black
population.  There,  the  African  American  population

Cotton Production and Producers,
1800–1860

Until 1820, Georgia and South Carolina
plantations (marked #7 and #8 on the
right side of the lower graph) grew
more than one-half of American cotton.
As output increased signiﬁcantly between
1820 and 1840 (see the upper graph), the
locus of production shifted. By the early
1840s, planters had moved hundreds of
thousands of slaves to the Mississippi
Valley, and Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Alabama (#4, #5, and #6) grew nearly
70 percent of a much larger cotton
crop. Simultaneously, production leapt
dramatically, reaching (as the red bars
show) 2 million bales a year by the mid-
1840s, 3 million by the mid-1850s, and
4 million on the eve of the Civil War.
