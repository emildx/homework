George Bellows, New York  George Bellows, a member of the so-called Ash Can school of painters
(Chapter 18), was fascinated by urban life. In this 1911 painting, he depicts Madison Square during a
winter rush-hour, crowded with streetcars, horse-drawn wagons, and pedestrians. If you could enter the
world of this painting, what might you hear, feel, and smell, as well as see? What does Bellows suggest
about the excitement and challenges of life in the big city? Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon, National Gallery of Art,
Washington, D.C.
