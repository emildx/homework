A Progressive Reports

from New Zealand

Henry Demarest Lloyd, a reform journalist discouraged by populism’s defeat in
the United States, toured New Zealand in 1899. Lloyd wanted to study New Zea-
land’s sudden burst of reform legislation stemming from a great industrial strike
in 1890 and, in its wake, a Labor Party election victory that precipitated dramatic
change.

Lloyd was one of many reformers who looked overseas for progressive ideas.
The  urban  settlement  movement  in  the  United  States  was  inspired  by  British
examples.  Municipal,  state,  and  federal  ofﬁcials  borrowed  innovative  policies
from  other  parts  of  the  industrializing  world — from  scientiﬁc  forest  manage-
ment to workmen’s compensation laws.

New Zealand democracy is the talk of the world to-day. It
has made itself the policeman and partner of industry to
an extent unknown elsewhere. It is the “experiment sta-
tion” of advanced legislation. . . .

Instead of escaping from the evils of the social order
by going to a new country, the Englishmen who settled
New Zealand found that they had brought all its prob-
lems with them. . . . The best acres were in the hands of
monopolists. . . . The little farmer, forced by unjust and
deliberately contrived laws to pay his own and his rich
neighbor’s taxes, had to sell out his little homestead to that
neighbor for what he could get. The workingman, able to
get neither land nor work, had to become a tramp. . . . The
blood of the people was the vintage of the rich.

Here is the record of ten years [of progressive legis-
lation]: . . . The rich man, because rich, is made to pay
more. . . .

By compulsory arbitration the public gets for the guid-
ance of public opinion all the facts as to disputes between
labor and capital, [and] puts an end to strikes and lock-
outs. . . . For the unemployed the nation makes itself a
labor bureau. It brings them and the employers together. It
reorganizes its public works and land system so as to give
land to the landless and work to the workless. . . . The state
itself insures the working people against accident.

. . . The nation’s railroads are used to redistribute
unemployed labour, to rebuild industry shattered by
calamity, to stimulate production by special rates to and

from farms and factories, to give health and education to
the school and factory population and the people gener-
ally by cheap excursions.

. . . Women are enfranchised. . . . On election day one

can see the baby-carriage standing in front of the polls
while the father and mother go in and vote — against each
other if they choose.

Last of all, pensions are given to the aged poor.
. . . We are exhorted to take “one step at a time” [but]
this theory does not fit the New Zealand evolution. . . . It
was not merely a change in parties; it was a change in
principles and institutions that amounted to nothing less
than a social right-about-face. It was a New Zealand revo-
lution, one which without destruction passed at once to
the tasks of construction.

QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS

1.  What reforms had New Zealand enacted, according to

Lloyd, and what problems did they solve?

2.  New Zealand had a population of one million in 1890,

mostly British immigrants and their descendants, with a
smaller number of native Maori. Why might reform have
been easier to achieve there than in the United States?

the first law providing public assistance for single moth-
ers with dependent children (Illinois, 1911) and the first
minimum wage law for women (Massachusetts, 1912).
Muller  had  drawbacks,  however.  Though  men  as
well  as  women  suffered  from  long  work  hours,  the
Muller case did not protect men. Brandeis’s brief treated
all women as potential mothers, focusing on the state’s

interest in protecting future children. Brandeis and his
allies hoped this would open the door to broader regu-
lation of working hours. The Supreme Court, however,
seized on motherhood as the key issue, asserting that
the female worker, because of her maternal function,
was “in a class by herself, and legislation for her protec-
tion may be sustained, even when like legislation is not
