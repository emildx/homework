The Politics of Democracy  As ordinary American men asserted a claim to a voice in government
affairs, politicians catered to their preferences and prejudices. Aspiring candidates took their messages to
voters, in rural hamlets as well as large towns. This detail from George Caleb Bingham’s Stump Speaking
(1855) shows a swanky, tail-coated politician on an improvised stage seeking the votes of an audience
of well-dressed gentlemen and local farmers — identiﬁed by their broad-brimmed hats and casual attire.
