scribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Con-
gress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,
except as to the Places of Chusing Senators.

The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year,
and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,
unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.*

Section  5.  Each House shall be the Judge of the  Elec-
tions, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a
Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business;
but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may
be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members,
in  such  Manner,  and  under  such  Penalties,  as  each  House
may provide.

Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,
punish  its  Members  for  disorderly  Behavior,  and,  with  the
Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.

Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and
from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as
may  in  their  Judgment  require  Secrecy;  and  the  Yeas  and
Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall,
at the Desire of one-fifth of those Present, be entered on the
Journal.

Neither  House,  during  the  Session  of  Congress,  shall,
without  the  Consent  of  the  other,  adjourn  for  more  than
three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two
Houses shall be sitting.

Section 6. The Senators and Representatives shall receive
a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law,
and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall
in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace,

House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.

approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his
Objections to that House in which it shall have originated,
who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and
proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two-
thirds  of  that  House  shall  agree  to  pass  the  Bill,  it  shall  be
sent,  together  with  the  Objections,  to  the  other  House,  by
which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by
two-thirds  of  that  House,  it  shall  become  a  Law.  But  in  all
such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by
Yeas  and  Nays,  and  the  Names  of  the  Persons  voting  for
and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each
House  respectively.  If  any  Bill  shall  not  be  returned  by  the
President  within  ten  Days  (Sundays  excepted)  after  it  shall
have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like
Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their
Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not
be a Law.

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concur-
rence of the Senate and the House of Representatives may be
necessary  (except  on  a  question  of  Adjournment)  shall  be
presented  to  the  President  of  the  United  States;  and  before
the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being
disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the
Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules
and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
