Coxey’s Army on the March, 1894  During the severe depression of the 1890s, Ohio businessman Jacob
Coxey organized unemployed men for a peaceful march to the U.S. Capitol to plead for an emergency jobs program.
They called themselves the Commonweal of Christ but won the nickname “Coxey’s Army.” Though it failed to win
sympathy from Congress, the army’s march on Washington — one of the nation’s ﬁrst — inspired similar groups to
set out from many cities. Here, Coxey’s group nears Washington, D.C. The man on horseback is Carl Browne, one of
the group’s leaders and a ﬂamboyant publicist. As the marchers entered Washington, Coxey’s seventeen-year-old
daughter Mamie, dressed as the “Goddess of Peace,” led the procession on a white Arabian horse. Library of Congress.
